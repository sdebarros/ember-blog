Unfortunately, there was a second regression in 1.1 that didn't get
caught in time to make it into 1.1.1. On that account 1.1.2 is out now
to correct that issue. For more information about the problem see
[Issue #3637](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/3637).

We recommend that everyone using 1.1.0 and 1.1.1 upgrade at their
nearest convenience. Head on over to [emberjs.com/builds](/builds)
to download. Our apologies for the inconvenience.

### Ember 1.2 Beta 2

While we were at it, we also released the second 1.2 beta which includes
a couple of bug fixes. 1.2.0-beta.2 is also available at
[emberjs.com/builds](/builds).
