## [Call for contributors: Shipping the Ember website(s) redesign 🎨🐹](https://twitter.com/melaniersumner/status/1254497875062673411)

Early last year, the community came together to [discuss the future of the design strategy of official Ember sites](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/425). After plenty of time and work investments from individual contributors, companies and the Ember Core team, the redesign for the main site [emberjs.com](https://emberjs.com) [shipped successfully](https://twitter.com/emberjs/status/1230912205631213569)!

Many other official resources for the Ember community, such as the [Blog](https://blog.emberjs.com/), [API Docs](https://api.emberjs.com/), and [CLI Guides](https://cli.emberjs.com/), are looking forward to get a new look & feel as well - and you can help with that! A [call for contributors](https://twitter.com/melaniersumner/status/1254497875062673411?s=21) is looking for those who have experience with JavaScript, HTML and CSS and who want to help shipping the website redesign.

Want to get started? Be sure to read the [official status update for the Ember Website](https://blog.emberjs.com/2020/04/26/update-ember-website.html) on the blog for more details on how to contribute. And feel free to reach out to the folks on the **#st-website** channel on the [Ember Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/zT3asNS) for any questions. We're looking forward to your contributions!

## [Yehuda's Octane tutorial continued 🔥](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/25/ember-octane-lets-go/)

Our very own [Yehuda Katz (@wycats)](https://github.com/wycats) wrote a blog series for an [Octane tutorial](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/25/ember-octane-lets-go/), and there are two new posts added to it.

The third part of the tutorial, [Pulling Out Data](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/30/ember-octane-a-data-file/), talks about moving data from HTML into a separate file. This is the part in the series that introduces you to writing JavaScript for the first time. You'll also learn how to build your helpers and write unit tests for them.

The fourth part of the tutorial, [Airtable Time](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/04/06/ember-octane-airtable-time/), talks about moving the JSON into Airtable. It is a great approach that will reduce the need for an application build for changing only data.

So far there are seven posts planned:

- [Let's Go](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/25/ember-octane-lets-go/)
- [Components](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/26/ember-octane-components/)
- [Pulling Out Data](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/30/ember-octane-a-data-file/)
- [Airtable Time](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/04/06/ember-octane-airtable-time/)
- Cleaning Things Up
- Adding More Pages
- Polishing: Server-Side Rendering, Prerendering and Code Splitting

So be on the lookout 👀 for more in this very helpful new series!

## [ember-bootstrap 4 release candidate 🛳](https://twitter.com/simonihmig/status/1255099221415510016)

This release candidate:

- Drops deprecated arguments for HTML attributes
- Overhauls the build setup, using Embroider macros!!!

Go ahead and check out the [release notes](https://github.com/kaliber5/ember-bootstrap/releases/tag/v4.0.0-rc.0) for a full set of changes. Shout out to the contributors of this RC [Jacob Jewell (@jakesjews)](https://github.com/jakesjews), [Jeldrik Hanschke (@jelhan)](https://github.com/jelhan) and [Simon Ihmig (@simonihmig)](https://github.com/simonihmig) for getting this done!

## [Strict mode templates RFC accepted 💖](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/496)

Strict mode templates RFC, for which the community discussion began in June 2019, was recently accepted by the Ember core teams. 🎉 You can read the RFC to [learn more about the proposed changes and motivations](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0496-handlebars-strict-mode.md).

At a high level, the "strict mode" (the terminology may change) is opt-in but intended to become the main way Ember users write templates. Once the strict mode is implemented (this may take time), the core teams and addon developers can start experimenting with **better ways to support your development workflow**. Experimental features such as **template imports** and **single-file components**, which build on top of the strict mode, will still need further design and iterations before they can be proposed and recommended to you.

In short, you don't need to worry about an immediate change. It is an exciting change to look forward to, because Ember has been using Handlebars for more than 8 years and we have learned how we can improve its language since. In the meantime, we encourage you to take a look at the [strict mode templates RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0496-handlebars-strict-mode.md)!
