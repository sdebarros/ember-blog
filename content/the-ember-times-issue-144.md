## [Call for contributors: join the strike team for accessibility in Ember](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/issues/595)

The Ember community put in lots of work into [framework features](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/accessibility/) and [addons](https://emberobserver.com/categories/accessibility) to allow us to build accessible and user-friendly applications. But still there is more work to be done to **address accessibility issues** in Ember.js and to improve the future of how we build JavaScript apps.

Do you want to be part of these efforts to help modern Ember apps become more accessible?

Then be sure to join the **#st-a11y strike team** on the [Ember Discord chat](https://discordapp.com/invite/emberjs)! The recently founded strike team for creating an **accessible JavaScript framework** has already put together a [detailed list of issues to work on](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/issues/595) and is counting on your support. On top of that, there are several accessibility-related issues in **ember-template-lint** that could use your help, so if tooling is your thing, please [check out the issues on Github](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint/issues) and see if there's a rule you can help write!

For more ideas, questions and discussion around a11y-related work, [join the strike team in the #st-a11y channel today](https://discord.gg/emberjs)!

## [Quest issue: drop mixins from ember-simple-auth 🔐](https://twitter.com/marcoow/status/1250411978339819522)

[Marco Otte-Witte (@marcoow)](https://github.com/marcoow) announced a [quest issue to Drop Mixins](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth/issues/2185) in [ember-simple-auth](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth).

The addon [ember-simple-auth](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth) is a lightweight library for implementing authentication and authorization with Ember.js applications. When it was originally designed, the addon was heavily leveraging [mixins](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/classes/Mixin) so it could be one-step integrated by developers into their applications. However, with [Native JavaScript classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), mixins aren't really well supported and you have to fall back to constructs like:

```js
export default class ProtectedRoute extends Route.extend(AuthenticatedRouteMixin) { }
```

Furthermore, eventually mixins will likely be removed from Ember altogether and they already trigger [linter warnings](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/blob/master/docs/rules/no-mixins.md). The quest issue details several options to deal with this such as [Ember Decorators](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0408-decorators.md) or Mixins that [do not rely](https://justinfagnani.com/2015/12/21/real-mixins-with-javascript-classes/) on the Ember Object model.

Try out [ember-simple-auth](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth) and take a look at the [quest issue](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth/issues/2185) with any feedback or ideas you might have!

## [RFC roundup 📣](https://twitter.com/emberjs)

The **2020 Ember Roadmap** Request for Comments (RFC) has been promoted to Final Comment Period (FCP). You can [read it here](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/519). This was a long-running RFC with a lot of community feedback over time! The Core Team is excited to solidify 2020's plan and focus their efforts.

The **Template Strict Mode** RFC has also entered FCP! This RFC from [Godfrey Chan (@chancancode)](https://github.com/chancancode) adds a new strict mode for Ember templates that has a clearer syntax with fewer ambiguities, and provides primitives for adding template imports in the future. Check it out [here](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/496).

## [Enjoy managing state with ember-statecharts 📈](https://twitter.com/LevelbossMike/status/1248247002489425921)

**State charts** are a method to model complex program behavior as a set of states that react to events. And being able to manage and predict state in a growing Ember application can be very useful.

And this is where [**ember-statecharts**](https://github.com/LevelbossMike/ember-statecharts) comes in: This Ember addon provides us with a new abstraction layer to define state charts in our app, based on the conventions from the powerful [xstate library](https://xstate.js.org/).

Want to learn more? Be sure to [check out the sparkling new documentation](https://twitter.com/LevelbossMike/status/1248247002489425921) and try it [for yourself](https://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-statecharts)!
