## [Investigate component arguments with the new Ember Inspector 🕵️‍♀️](https://twitter.com/chancancode/status/1258514680256987136)

The brand-new, 4.0 version of [Ember Inspector](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/ember-inspector/) - the best tool for **inspecting and debugging your Ember applications** - is out! The recent release comes not only with lots of valuable bug fixes, but also with many amazing features, including:

- Inspection of **component arguments**: You can now see and investigate [arguments](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0311-angle-bracket-invocation.html#arguments) passed to your components through Ember Inspector's component tree 🌳
- Inspection of **the store**: Directly inspect your data store and send it as a variable for further debugging to your console. You can check out a demo recording of this feature in the [PR description](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-inspector/pull/1163) of [Sarah Yu's (@SYU15)](https://github.com/SYU15) work 🏬
- Navigate through the component tree via **keyboard** with a new [accessibility improvement](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-inspector/pull/1153) 🎹

## [Blog post: Comparing Ember Octane and React 🐹⚛️](https://www.pzuraq.com/comparing-ember-octane-and-react/)

[Chris Garrett (@pzuraq)](https://github.com/pzuraq) wrote a blog post [comparing Ember Octane and React](https://www.pzuraq.com/comparing-ember-octane-and-react/) in terms of their respective programming models and developer experience using the latest idioms and best practices from both frameworks (Ember Octane and React Hooks).

The blog post goes through an in-depth analysis of the programming models between Ember and React including how they handle derived values and state, lifecycle hooks or methods to handle scheduling, and handling user interaction.

Check out the [takeaways](https://www.pzuraq.com/comparing-ember-octane-and-react/) from this comparison in the full blog post!

## [Auto save en Ember Octane 💾](https://betocantu93.com/autosave-in-ember-octane/)

[Alberto Cantú (@betocantu93)](https://github.com/betocantu93), in his first blog post in Spanish, explores [how to implement autosave in Ember](https://betocantu93.com/autosave-in-ember-octane/). We encourage you to check it out! Alberto starts with a basic form with a submit button, then introduces autosave and addresses potential problems using `ember-concurrency`.

Do you follow a similar pattern or have another approach to autosaving your user's form? Share your ideas with the JS community today!

## [ember-keyboard RFC ⌨️](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-keyboard/pull/135)

If you've ever wondered about some of the finer details of the `code` and `key` properties of keyboard events in modern browsers, you may want to check out [Luke Melia's (@lukemelia)](https://github.com/lukemelia) recent [RFC](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-keyboard/pull/135) for `ember-keyboard`. 

In case you didn't know, `ember-keyboard` is a ✨fantastic✨ Ember addon for the painless support of keyboard events. 

<!-- alex ignore just-->
The team that supports `ember-keyboard` could really use community feedback on this one so if you're a user of the addon, interested in the subject or just feel like helping out, please head on over to the RFC and comment!
